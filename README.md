QUESTIONS

• Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    - Long story short, the objective of the project was to create a system to calculate compound interest over time.
• What did you do particularly well?
    - I think I was able to create clean, readable code.
• Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    - I think that I could make the code more object oriented as well as include more functions to run my code, rather than putting most of the code in the main() function
• Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    - Implementing the math equations to calculate the interest is what the most challenging part was for me. I used mathway.com to make sure I was getting the right numbers when I was done. 
• What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    - Skills I learned from this project was how to use for loops to help me calculate the compound interest. 
• How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    - I broke it down into two main things that I needed to do. Calculate interest without monthly deposits, and with monthly deposits. Then, from there I made the equations and the rest was easy, such as getting user input and printing to the screen.
