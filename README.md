QUESTIONS

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Long story short, the objective of the project was to create a system to calculate compound interest over time.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I think I was able to create clean, readable code.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think that I could make the code more object oriented as well as include more functions to run my code, rather than putting most of the code in the main() function

5. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Implementing the math equations to calculate the interest is what the most challenging part was for me. I used mathway.com to make sure I was getting the right numbers when I was done.

6. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Skills I learned from this project was how to use for loops to help me calculate the compound interest.

7. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I broke it down into two main things that I needed to do. Calculate interest without monthly deposits, and with monthly deposits. Then, from there I made the equations and the rest was easy, such as getting user input and printing to the screen.
